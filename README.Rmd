## Abstract

Given the observed deterioration in mental health among Australians over the past decade, this study investigates to what extent this differs in people born in different decades –i.e. possible cohort differences in mental health among young people in Australia. Using 20 years of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we find strong evidence that cohort effects are driving the declines in mental health. Deteriorating mental health is particularly pronounced among the 1990s cohort, and seen to a lessor extent among the 1980s cohort. There is little evidence that mental health is worsening with age for people born prior to the 1980s. The findings from this study highlight that Millenials are driving the deterioration in population-level mental health. Understanding the changes in society that have differentially affected younger people may help ameliorate this trend, and prevent it continuing for emerging cohorts.

In many countries there has been an increase in the prevalence of mental ill health, even prior to COVID, alongside increasing use of both psychotropics and therapeutic services [@peach2022mental]. For instance, the proportion of Australians reporting high or very high levels of psychological distress has increased year-on-year from 10.8% in 2011-12 to 15.4% in 2020-21 according to the ABS [@abs2022]. This rise in psychological distress was particularly prevalent among younger age groups, with 18-24 year olds reporting the largest increase from 11.8% in 2011-12 to 20.1% in 2020-21. These increases are also mirrored in large, longitudinal panel surveys such as the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey [@butterworth2020trends], as well as the prevalence of recent mental disorders in focused population-based mental health surveys, where an increase from 13.4% in 2011-12 to 20.4% in 2020-21, including almost two in five people (39.6%) aged 16-24 has just been reported [@abs2022].  

Other OECD countries have observed similar declines in population levels of mental health, including among young people in the UK, USA, Netherlands, and Japan [@twenge2019age; @ormel2022more; @hidaka2012depression; @nishi2018trends], though not all [e.g., Canada, @patten2016major]. In many cases these changes can be attributed to changing age structures as the national population grows (i.e., *age effects*) [@vos2016global; @ferrari2013burden; @baxter2014challenging], or due to periods of disruption such as the global financial crisis (GFC) or the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of economic opportunity these entail (i.e., *period effects*) [@glozier2022happened; @butterworth2022lockdown].

Age effects can influence the population-level trends when the age-structure of the population changes to include more age-groups with poorer mental health. Comparing age groups over the population has revealed a U-shaped pattern in mental wellbeing in large cross-sectional surveys, whereby hedonic aspects of wellbeing decline from young age-groups (e.g., 18-20) to middle-age (50-55) before increasing to a peak at 70-75, although there are cultural and national differences [@stone2010snapshot; @steptoe2015subjective]. In Australia, @burns2020age described age-related changes in the mental health of Australian adults using 17 years of HILDA data (2001-2017). Using the mental health inventory (MHI-5), they report only very small differences in mental health over age-groups, however there was an emerging downward trend for the youngest (18-24) and very oldest adults (75+) in the more recent years. @butterworth2020trends has found deteriorating trends in mental health in Australia. Also using HILDA data, @butterworth2020trends found an increase in psychological distress (K10 scores) from 4.8% to 7.4% between 2007 to 2017, but only among 18-34 and 35-64 age groups in this representative longitudinal sample.   

Apart from age-related changes, which may reflect normal but temporary developmental changes in mental health over the life-span, mental health may also vary by birth cohort. Cohort effects refer to variance over time that is specific to individuals born in or around certain years (i.e., generational differences between “millenials” and “baby boomers”). Cohort differences in mental health are not likely to be temporary as they are associated with the person-specific differences which persist over the age-range. Moreover because of the linear dependency between age-, cohort-, and period-effects [@bell2020age; @fienberg1978identification; @kratz2021age], correctly disentangling age-related effects from cohort effects in mental health is fraught, but crucial if we are to identify the groups most at risk. There is no technical way to solve the dependency and identify the unique effect of each in a linear model [@fienberg1978identification; @luo2013assessing; @holford1983estimation]. Adding covariates changes the model but not the identification problem. The only way to solve this issue is by fiat; that is by conceding some constraint whose appropriateness cannot be tested [@fienberg2013cohort; @fienberg1985specification; @mason1985cohort], or by focusing on nonlinear effects and possibly some interactions [@bell2020age].  

In this paper, we aim to distinguish whether the widely-observed decline in mental health in Australia is due to variation with age, or differences between birth cohorts. To remove the linear dependency and identify any differences in trends between cohorts, we model mental health (MHI-5 scores) for each cohort as a nonlinear smooth function of age. Comparisons between smooths allows us to determine whether the average level of mental health differs between cohorts (controlling for age), and whether the _trajectory_ of mental health (over age) differs between cohorts.  

## Methods  

```{r import_data}
hilda.data <- read_rds("data/preprocessed.RDS") %>% 
  select(xwaveid, year, sex, age, ghmh, pdk10s, topup) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ghmh)) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age <= 14 ~ "0-14",  # there is n = 1 fourteen year old
      age <= 24 ~ "15-24", 
      age <= 34 ~ "25-34",
      age <= 44 ~ "35-44",
      age <= 54 ~ "45-54",
      age <= 65 ~ "55-64",
      age <= 75 ~ "65-74",
      age <= 85 ~ "75-84",
      TRUE      ~ "85+"),
    birthyear = year - age,
    cohort = case_when(
      birthyear %in% 1900:1929 ~ "1920s",
      birthyear %in% 1930:1939 ~ "1930s", 
      birthyear %in% 1940:1949 ~ "1940s",
      birthyear %in% 1950:1959 ~ "1950s",
      birthyear %in% 1960:1969 ~ "1960s",
      birthyear %in% 1970:1979 ~ "1970s",
      birthyear %in% 1980:1989 ~ "1980s",
      birthyear %in% 1990:1999 ~ "1990s",
      birthyear %in% 2000:2009 ~ "2000s", 
      birthyear %in% 2010:2020 ~ "2010s", 
      TRUE ~ "problem"
    )) %>%
  mutate(xwaveid = factor(xwaveid),
         ocohort = ordered(cohort),
         fcohort = factor(cohort))
```

#### Sample selection  

The sample included all persons over the age of 14 in the household who completed the SCQ (Self Completion Questionnaire) in each year. The birth cohort of each person were defined by the decade of birth year (1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s). Thus persons can only contribute to a single birth cohort, but can be observed multiple times across survey years/ages. Persons were excluded if they were born prior to 1940 or after 1999, as after stratification by age they represented cohorts with sample sizes smaller than desirable for estimation of penalised nonlinear GAMs. An MHi-5 score was estimated for each person/year for which there were valid responses on greater than or equal to half the items, where missing data was replaced with the average score on the valid items (imputation was performed by  HILDA, as per the planned survey design to minimise attrition and sampling error). Thus missing scores were excluded on a year-by-person basis. Demographic details of the sample are provided in the Results in Table 1 below.

<br><br>

#### Measures  

The MHi-5 is a well-validated subset of 5 items from the mental health component of SF-36 dealing with positive and negative aspects of mental health [@batterham2018assessing; @cuijpers2009screening; @ware2000sf; @ware1992mos]:  

1. "Been a nervous person"
2. "Felt so down in the dumps nothing could cheer you up"
3. "Felt calm and peaceful"
4. "Felt down"
5. "Been a happy person"  

Items were scored to ensure higher scores represented better mental health.  

```
if appropriate please add some blurb about how good the MHi-5 is, or how widely used/useful it is in Australia
```

<br><br>

#### Analysis  

We estimate penalized smooth trends for each cohort using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) in a generalized additive mixed modelling (GAMM) setting, described by Wood et al [@wood2004stable; @wood2006low; @wood2011fast; @wood2016smoothing]. This is an analogue to a linear multilevel model with varying intercepts and slopes among the cohorts, but here the slopes are allowed to "wiggle". The model includes a global smoothing term for the effect of age as well as cohort-specific terms, so each cohort is allowed to have it's own functional response but the penalty ensures that functions too far from average are penalized.  

Each smoother $f_k$ is represented by a sum of $K$ simpler, fixed basis functions. The basis functions (splines) were estimated by quadratically penalized likelihood maximization for automatic smoothness selection, with a starting value of $K=9$.

$\ \ \ \ y_{it} = \beta_{k}(cohort_i) + f(age_{it}) + f_{[k]} (age_{it}) + \zeta_{i} + \epsilon_{it}$

$\ \ \ \ \epsilon_{it} \sim N(0, \phi \sigma^2)$

Where $y_{it}$ is the MHI-5 score for each person $i$ over age $t$; $\beta_{[k]}$ is the mean MHI-5 estimate for each $k = 1...6$ birth cohort, after accounting for variations in trend over age; and $f_{[k]}$ are smooth functions for the trend in MHI-5 scores over age for each cohort.  

The smooth trends were centered for identifiability reasons [@marra2012coverage; @wood2013p], however the resulting model estimation allowed two important comparisons: Firstly the mean MHI-5 estimates ($\beta_{[k]}$) provided comparisons for the average difference in mental health between cohorts. However interpreting these differences is difficult in the presence of trends over age in each cohort. For example, a mean difference could be due to a decreasing trend with age in one cohort or an increasing trend in the other cohort, rather than consistent differences in mental health over the age range. Thus an important advantage provided by the current model are the centered $f_{[k]}$ smooth functions from which differences in trends between cohorts are directly estimated. The resulting difference smooths are also centered around zero and so mean differences in mental health are not accounted for by these smooths, but they will reveal whether mental health is changing with age in one cohort relative to the other cohort (aka _reference_ cohort). The difference smooths also directly estimate the uncertainty around the difference, with confidence intervals that include the uncertainty about the mean difference as well as the centered smooth itself. This results in intervals with close to nominal (frequentist) coverage probabilities [@marra2012coverage].   

We did not compare cohorts more than a decade apart since there are few or no overlapping age groups observed, so we restricted ourselves to the five ($K-1$) pairwise comparisons between each cohort and the next oldest cohort (i.e., the *reference* cohort).  

To account for the person-level dependency when survey participants are measured more than once, we included a first-order autoregressive AR(1) term $\phi$ for the residuals based on the unique crosswave ID for each person $i = 1...I$, which is equivalent to including the person-level random intercept $\zeta_i$ nested within cohort. In sensitivity analyses we explored the influence of period effects, sex, and first interview, as well as comparisons with psychological distress. The results are presented in the appendix.

Younger cohorts in our sample are more likely to have lower mental health (MHI-5 score), higher distress, more likely to be single and unemployed, and less likely to be chronically ill or disabled.

Figure 1 shows changes in mental health scores (MHI-5) in each survey year by age at time of survey (left panel), and the trends in each birth cohort as it ages (right panel), where the dotted line represents the average age effect ignoring cohort. Mental health is worse for younger age-groups in each survey year and this age-related discrepancy increases in more recent surveys (left panel), consistent with a cohort effect. The right panel shows that mental health is worse for younger generations, where deviations from the dotted line indicate the presence of a cohort effect. In particular *Millenials* (those born in the 1990s) have a lower score at the same age as older generations. At age 30 the average MHI-5 score (on the 0-100 scale) of those born in the 1990s is about 67, compared to about 72.5 and 74 for people born in the 1980s and 1970s respectively.  

Some combinations of ages/years were not observed for all age-groups (left panel) or cohorts (right panel). For example, people born prior to 1940 were excluded (see methods) and so the earliest year observed for the oldest age-group (65-74) was 2006,  and the left panel shows the trend line for that age-group does not extend earlier than 2006. Likewise, the earliest age observed of people born in the 1940s was 52, and so the trend line for that cohort does not extend earlier than that age (right panel).  

Some trend lines are flat (e.g., left panel, ages 65-74; right panel, 1960s cohort), which is a result of the penalised smoothing spline determining that no additional degrees of freedom are required to support curvature in order to explain the variance in that group over years/ages.  

Uncertainty is not quantified (e.g., confidence intervals) in these plots, but pairwise comparisons of the average difference between each cohort and the next oldest cohort (reference cohort) is presented below in Table 3. Moreover, Figure 2 presents the difference smooths for each pairwise comparison in order to statistically compare the trends over age between cohorts.   

<br><br>

##### Table 3. Pairwise differences in average mental health between cohorts

  filter(str_detect(term, "cohort")) %>%

  mutate(contrast = str_replace(contrast, "v", "s - "))
```

<br>

Significant pairwise differences between each cohort and the reference cohort occurred (*ps* < .05), indicating lower mental health scores in the younger cohort of each comparison. These results represent the mean differences in MHI-5 scores of each cohort, and as such interpreting these differences is difficult in the presence of trends over age in each cohort. For example, the mean difference could be due to a decreasing trend with age in the younger cohort, or an increasing trend in the older cohort, rather than differences in mental health over all ages. Paiwise comparisons of the smooth trends over age for each cohort are presented below.    



Figure 2 shows the smooth trend estimates, along with 95% credible/confidence intervals (which include the uncertainty about the overall mean as well as the centred smooth itself). In each row the older cohort is shown in the left column as the 'reference smooth', and the estimated difference between the reference cohort and the cohort born in the subsequent decade is shown in the right column as the 'difference smooth'. A signficant difference in trend or slope is indicated by 95% confidence/credible intervals which exclude zero (horizonal line) in opposite directions at each endpoint.

The trend in the centered difference smooths (right panels) reveals whether the _change_ in MHI-5 scores or slope of the younger cohort is significantly different from the slope of the older reference cohort (left panels) over the same age range, i.e., a cohort effect. For example a significant negative slope in the right panel demonstrates MHI-5 scores are declining in the younger cohort at a faster rate than the reference cohort. However a negative slope in the right panel does not by itself indicate whether average MHI-5 scores are deteriorating in that cohort. Inspection of the reference cohort in the left panel is necessary to determine whether the decline represents a true deterioration in mental health. For example, the 1990s difference panel reveals the youngest cohort's mental health trajectory is significantly declining with age relative to the 1980s cohort, and the 1980s smooth (reference in the right panel) is also significantly deteriorating relative to its own mean baseline. Together this represents evidence that MHI-5 scores in the 1990s cohort are declining faster than the deteriorating mental health of the 1980s cohort. Compare to the 1960s difference smooth in the right panel, where there is also a significant negative slope however the trend in the 1950s reference smooth (left panel) is positive, so the negative difference in the right panel is not due to changes in the 1960s cohort but rather improvements in the 1950s cohort. In general, no cohort shows a steeper decline relative to its reference than the 1990s cohort, and when cohorts older than 1990s tend to decline relative to their older reference cohort (right panels) it is not due to a deterioration relative to their own mean baseline (left panels).   

The statistical significance of the smooth differences indicates where the slope in differences between cohorts are non-zero (i.e., positive or negative). As such they reveal the presence of cohort-effects adjusted for age. P-values based on Nychka (1988) are shown below.

map_dfr(gam.list, .f = broom::tidy, .id = "model") %>%
  left_join(
    map_dfr(gam.list, .f = ~mgcv:::k.check(.) %>% 
              as_tibble(rownames = "term"), 
            .id = "model"),
    by = c("model", "term", "edf")
  ) %>%
  select(term, `k-index`, edf, F.value = statistic, p.value) %>%
  filter(str_detect(term, "ocohort")) %>%
  mutate(term = str_remove(term, "s\\(age\\):ocohort"),
         term = paste(term, "difference")) %>%
  mutate(across(`k-index`:F.value, ~round(., 2))) %>%
  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, 3))
```

<br>

The p-values indicate that cohort effects exist between each of the younger cohorts and the next oldest cohort, with the exception of the 1960s cohort difference from the 1950s, and the 1950s difference from 1940s.

#### Sensitivity Tests

In addition to the main analysis, we conducted several sensitivity tests, the results of which are reported in the Appendix. First, we tested for any gender differences in cohort effects of mental health (Figure A1). The results are very similar to those reported for the full sample in Figure 1. The intercepts for men and women are different, with men’s average mental health being better than women’s average mental health. However, men and women have similar mental health trajectory differences between cohorts. Second, in 2011 the HILDA Survey added a top-up sample of new respondents. This was also around the same time that we start observing declines in mental health (see Figure 1, left panel). To ensure that the declining mental health trajectories are not driven by some unobserved characteristics of the respondents in the top-up sample, we also conducted the analyses excluding top-sample members. The results, shown in Figure A2, are similar to those in Figure 1 (right panel) and do not change the cohort trajectories. Third, instead of the MHI-5, we also applied the Kessler-10 (K10) psychological distress scale. K10 scores were collected in the HILDA Survey in alternate years from 2007 to 2019. The corresponding psychological distress trajectories for each cohort are shown in Figure A3, with higher K10 scores suggesting greater psychological distress. The trajectory patterns are consistent with those observed for the MHI-5 scale in Figure 1 (right panel), as psychological distress was higher for younger cohorts than older cohorts at the same age.

## Discussion

Population levels of mental health in Australia have been declining over the past decade or so. This is especially the case for younger adults aged between 15 and 35. Although there has been consistent debate about the possible drivers of these declining mental health trajectories (Skinner et al., 2022), little work has been done to try and identify more precisely the source of these patterns.  

Using 20 years of longitudinal data we modelled the changes to mental health over age in Australia in a flexible non-linear model. Our model allowed us to compare mental health between cohorts, adjusted for age, and find that the observed deterioration in mental health in Australia is most consistent with a cohort effect rather than a (temporary) age-effect. Importantly, it is the youngest cohorts and especially 1990s birth cohort that is experiencing a decreasing trajectory of mental health over time. Individuals in this cohort report worse mental health than older cohorts at the same ages, and because our model allowed us to project/predict future trajectories on the basis of the current trajectory, we can expect this decline in the youngest generations to continue. Thus, the deterioration in mental health over time which has been reported in large cross-sectional surveys, is likely due to cohort-specific effects, related to the experience of young people born in the Millenial generation and may be unlikely to spontaneously resolve. These findings are similar for men and women, and the results are robust to alternative samples and measures used.

In comparison to other research on age effects in large population-based surveys, there are few examples examining mental health but many have focused on subjective wellbeing evaluated by a single item life-satisfaction question, also known as *cognitive* wellbeing, *evaluative* wellbeing or "happiness". There it has been pointed out that almost every plausible pattern of age-happiness trajectory has been reported in the literature [@kratz2021age], and further shown the pattern observed depends on the model adopted for analysis. For instance we employed a random intercept model and observed a U-shaped effect of age on mental health, and @kratz2021age showed that pattern can be produced by a random intercept model which yields biased age effects due to endogenous selection of happier people with age. However a sensitivty analysis which controlled for controlled for endogenous effects by mean centering MHI-5 scores within-person [and including the mean score as a predictor, @ligthart2016comparison] also observed a  U-shaped pattern in age effects, demonstrating the results we report here are not biased by endogeneity. An important consideration is that MHI-5 measures a distinct construct from life-satisfaction (aka "happiness"), and so represents a distinct psychological construct [@diener2017findings]; for instance it has a different time-course in responses to major life events [@kettlewell2020differential]. And it is worth noting that when we examined age-effects on life-satisfaction, we did not observe cohort specific trajectories as we found with mental health.

#### Limitations  

We did not include major life events in our model because they can act as mediators that result from age and affect the response [@kettlewell2020differential]. We also did not include other potential mediators such as health status, relationship status, employment status, household income or region. As such our results should be considered a description of the *total* effect of age on mental health, rather than any causal explanation, which is consistent with our aim to describe the cohort-related differences rather than explain them. Likewise our aim was not to build a prediction model to extrapolate beyond the range of data, and instead we prefer to note the expansion of the appropriately adjusted 95% confidence/credible intervals when estimating future observations for any particular cohort.  

This study is intended as a starting point for more in-depth analysis or to invigorate other researchers to examine more closely the changes in mental health happening in Australia in the last decade. Understanding the exact causes of these patterns, in addition to appropriately targeted interventions, may be critical if the deteriorating pattern is to be arrested or shifted.

## Appendix

#### Period effects  

Period effects refer to variance over time that is common across all age groups and cohorts, due to population-wide events such as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 or the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. We estimated the nonlinear effect of period over the complete set of survey years (2000 to 2020) as a smooth term in a model with cohort and (smooth) age effects:  

$\ \ \ \ y_{it} = \beta_{k}(cohort_i) + f(age_{it}) + f_{[k]} (age_{it}) + f(year_t) + \zeta_{i} + \epsilon_{it}$

$\ \ \ \ \epsilon_{it} \sim N(0,  \sigma^2)$

The centered smooth effect of period (after accounting for nonlinear age and cohort effects) is shown below.  

```{r load_fullfit, include=F}
fit <- read_rds("results/full_fit_w_period.rds")

plot_obj <- plot(fit, seWithMean = T)
```

                fill = "grey80") +

```

<br>

The results confirmed there was a slow decline in average MHI-5 scores over the survey period, which we have already seen is not equally shared by all age-groups or cohorts (e.g,. Figure 1).  

After including a smooth term for period we estimated the smooth trajectory of mental health for each cohort, and in a post-estimation procedure calculated the difference between cohort smooths in a pairwise fashion. In contrast to the results reported in Figure 2, these difference smooths are not directly estimated and so while each comparison includes overlapping ages, age is not matched exactly in each pairwise comparison (up to ±5 years lag may be present). Nevertheless the pattern of differences supports the same inferences drawn from Figure 2, and demonstrates that period effects are not an influential presence in the cohort differences we report here.

#### Risk of mental illness  

While the MHI-5 is not a diagnostic instrument, it has good psychometric properties when identifying DSM-V disorders in a community sample (AUC 0.877, Batterham, Sunderland, Slade, Calear, & Carragher, 2018). We used a cut-off value of 52 to identify people at risk of mental illness and estimated the prevalence of illness for each age-group and cohort.
