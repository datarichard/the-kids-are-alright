# the labour force, marginally attached; 6 Not in the labour force, not 
# marginally attached; 7 Employed, but usual hours worked unknown 

"jbmcnt"
# Looking at SHOWCARD C23, which of these categories best describes your current
# contract of employment?  Employed on a fixed-term contract, Employed on a 
# casual basis, Employed on a permanent or ongoing basis, Other

"jbcasab"

# Split data into casual vs permanent, then show split of casual into the three 
# age groups

"jbmlh"
# Employed through labour-hire firm or temporary employment agency
# 

"esempst"
# Self-employed is not indicated in ESDTL, but is indicated in ESEMPST and ESEMPDT
