## Abstract

Given the observed deterioration in mental health among Australians over
the past decade, especially among younger individuals, this study
investigates possible cohort differences in mental health among young
people in Australia. Using 20 years of data from the Household, Income
and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we find strong evidence
that cohort effects are driving the declines in mental health.
Deteriorating mental health is particularly pronounced among the 1990s
cohort, but also among the 1980s cohort. There is little evidence that
mental health is worsening with age for people born prior to the 1980s.
The findings from this study highlight that the 1980s and especially
1990s cohorts are driving the deterioration in population-level mental
health, and that targeted inventions are required specifically on these
groups.

<br><br>

Recent deterioration in mental health in Australia, especially among
young people, has spurred much speculation around the causes of the
decline and what can be done to arrest it (Skinner, Occhipinti, Song, &
Hickie, 2022). For instance, the proportion of Australians reporting
high or very high levels of psychological distress has increased
year-on-year from 10.8% in 2011-12 to 15.4% in 2020-21 according to the
ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022). This rise in psychological
distress was particularly prevalent among younger age groups, with 18-24
year olds reporting the largest increase from 11.8% in 2011-12 to 20.1%
in 2020-21. These increases are also mirrored in longitudinal surveys of
mental health such as the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in
Australia (HILDA) Survey (Butterworth, Watson, & Wooden, 2020), as well
as the prevalence of recent mental disorders, which has increased from
13.4% in 2011-12 to 20.4% in 2020-21, including almost two in five
people (39.6%) aged 16-24 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022).

Other OECD countries have observed similar declines in population levels
of mental health, including among young people in the UK, USA,
Netherlands, and Japan (Hidaka, 2012; Nishi, Susukida, Usuda, Mojtabai,
& Yamanouchi, 2018; Ormel, Hollon, Kessler, Cuijpers, & Monroe, 2022),
though not all (e.g., Canada, Patten et al., 2016). In many cases these
changes can be attributed to the overall growth of the global population
and its changing age structure (i.e., *age effects*) (Baxter et al.,
2014; Ferrari et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2016), or loss of economic
opportunity due to periods of disruption such as the global financial
crisis (GFC) or the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., *period effects*)
(Butterworth, Schurer, Trinh, Vera-Toscano, & Wooden, 2022; Glozier,
Morris, & Schurer, 2022).

Age effects can influence the population-level trends when mental health
changes over the lifespan as part of normal development or aging, and
the age-structure of the population also changes to include more
age-groups with poorer mental health. Comparing age groups over the
population has revealed a U-shaped pattern in affective wellbeing
(similar to mental health) in large cross-sectional surveys, whereby
hedonic aspects of wellbeing decline from young age-groups (e.g., 18-20)
to middle-age (50-55) before increasing to a peak at 70-75, although
there are cultural and national differences (Steptoe, Deaton, & Stone,
2015; Stone, Schwartz, Broderick, & Deaton, 2010). In Australia, Burns,
Butterworth, & Crisp (2020) described the cross-sectional differences in
the mental health of Australian adults using 17 years of HILDA data
(2001-2017). Using the mental health inventory (MHI-5), they report only
very small differences in mental health over age-groups, however there
was an emerging downward trend for the youngest (18-24) and very oldest
adults (75+) in the more recent years. A cohort trajectory analysis
indicated there is an improvement in mental health as people age before
a substantial decline after 75 years of age, but little evidence of any
cohort-specific effects.

Period effects refer to variance over time that is common across all age
groups, such as due to the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. For
example in Australia, lockdowns during COVID-19 significantly reduced
the mental health of women with children in 2020 (Butterworth et al.,
2022; Schurer, Atalay, Glozier, Vera-Toscano, & Wooden, 2022). However,
the pandemic cannot explain the deteriorating longitudinal trends in
mental health observed before 2020 in Australia. Also using HILDA data,
Butterworth et al. (2020) found an increase in psychological distress
(K10 scores) from 4.8% to 7.4% between 2007 to 2017, but only among
18-34 and 35-64 age groups in a representative longitudinal sample. The
GFC in 2008 may represent a period effect responsible for such a
decline, as it appears restricted to working-aged people who may be more
adversely impacted by wide-spread changes in economic conditions.

Because mental health changes over time and with age for various reasons
(broadly distinguished so far as age- or period- effects), accurately
locating the source of any such varying trend is critical before
targeted interventions can be effective. The evidence reviewed so far
indicates trends in mental health may exist, yet comparisons between
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reveal inconsistencies (e.g.,
Butterworth et al., 2020).

Since Fienberg & Mason (1978), researchers have recognised that a
critical concern is whether the changes observed are due to age-,
period-, or *cohort* effects (e.g., Bell, 2020; Burns et al., 2020;
Fukuda, 2013; Kratz & Brüderl, 2021). Cohort effects refer to variance
over time that is specific to individuals born in or around certain
years (i.e., generational differences between “millenials” and “baby
boomers”). Because age effects (A) are a linear combination of period
(P) and cohort (C) effects (A = P - C), there is no technical way to
solve the dependency and identify the unique effect of each in a linear
model (Fienberg & Mason, 1978; Holford, 1983; Luo, 2013). Adding
covariates to the linear APC model changes the model but not the
identification problem. The only way to solve this issue is by fiat;
that is by conceding some constraint whose appropriateness cannot be
tested (Fienberg, 2013; Fienberg & Mason, 1985; Mason & Fienberg, 1985),
or by focusing on nonlinear effects and possibly some interactions
(Bell, 2020).

In this paper, we aim to distinguish whether the widely-observed decline
in mental health in Australia is due to variation with age, or common
effects of the recent period, or differences between birth cohorts. To
identify any recent period effect, we explicitly model mental health
(MHi-5 scores) for each age-group as a nonlinear smooth function of
time. To identify cohort effects from age effects, we explicitly model
mental health for each birth cohort as a nonlinear smooth function of
age. Comparisons between smooths allow us to determine where any
differences between age-groups or cohorts occurred.

## Methods

We estimate penalized smooth trends for each cohort using restricted
maximum likelihood (REML) in a generalized additive mixed modelling
(GAMM) approach, described by Wood et al (Wood, 2004, 2006, 2011; Wood,
Pya, & Säfken, 2016). This is an analogue to a linear multilevel model
with varying intercepts and slopes among the cohorts, but here the
slopes are allowed to “wiggle”. The model includes a global smoothing
term for the effect of age as well as cohort-specific terms, so each
cohort is allowed to have it’s own functional response but the penalty
ensures that functions too far from average are penalized.

Each smoother
![f_k](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;f_k "f_k")
is represented by a sum of
![K](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;K "K")
simpler, fixed basis functions. The basis functions (splines) were
estimated by quadratically penalized likelihood maximization for
automatic smoothness selection, with a starting value of
![K=9](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;K%3D9 "K=9").

![\\ \\ \\ \\ y\_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\beta\_{k}(cohort_i) + f(age\_{it}) + f\_{\[k\]} (age\_{it}) + \\zeta\_{i} + \\epsilon\_{it}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5C%20%5C%20%5C%20%5C%20y_%7Bit%7D%20%3D%20%5Calpha_i%20%2B%20%5Cbeta_%7Bk%7D%28cohort_i%29%20%2B%20f%28age_%7Bit%7D%29%20%2B%20f_%7B%5Bk%5D%7D%20%28age_%7Bit%7D%29%20%2B%20%5Czeta_%7Bi%7D%20%2B%20%5Cepsilon_%7Bit%7D "\ \ \ \ y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_{k}(cohort_i) + f(age_{it}) + f_{[k]} (age_{it}) + \zeta_{i} + \epsilon_{it}")

Where
![y\_{it}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;y_%7Bit%7D "y_{it}")
is the person-centered MHI-5 score,
![\\alpha_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Calpha_i "\alpha_i")
is the person-level mean MHI-5 score,
![\\beta\_{\[k\]}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cbeta_%7B%5Bk%5D%7D "\beta_{[k]}")
is the mean MHI-5 score for each
![k = 1...K](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;k%20%3D%201...K "k = 1...K")
birth cohort, and
![f\_{\[k\]}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;f_%7B%5Bk%5D%7D "f_{[k]}")
are smooth functions for the trend in MHI-5 scores over age for each
cohort. To account for the person-level dependency when survey
participants are measured more than once, we included a first-order
autoregressive AR(1) term
![\\phi](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cphi "\phi")
for the residuals based on the unique crosswave ID for each person
![i = 1...I](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;i%20%3D%201...I "i = 1...I"),
which is equivalent to including the person-level random intercept
![\\zeta_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Czeta_i "\zeta_i")
nested within cohort.

We aimed to compare the smooth trends of each cohort to the next
generation (e.g., 1990s vs 1980s) so as to infer whether the trend is
increasing or decreasing *relative* to the next. We cannot compare
trends from birth cohorts more than two decades apart since there are
few or none overlapping age groups observed, so we restrict ourselves to
the five
(![K-1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;K-1 "K-1"))
pairwise comparisons between each cohort and the next.

## Results

The demographics of each cohort are shown in Table 1 below. Only the
most recent observation from each person is included.

#### Table 1. Demographics stratified by birth cohort

<br>

Younger cohorts are more likely to have lower mental health (MHI-5
score), higher distress, more likely to be single and unemployed, and
less likely to be chronically ill or disabled.

The complete range of ages is shown in the table below, which includes
every observation of every person in every year available.

Figure 1 shows changes in mental health scores (MHI-5) over time by age
(left panel), as well as birth cohort (right panel), where the dotted
line represents the average age effect ignoring cohort. Mental health is
worse for younger age-groups and even worse again for more recent
younger age groups (left panel), that is, consistent with a cohort
effect. The right panel shows mental health is worse for younger
generations, where deviations from the dotted line indicate the presence
of a cohort effect. In particular *Millenials* born in the 1990s have a
lower score at the same age as older generations, where at age 30 the
average MHI-5 score (on the 0-100 scale) of those born in the 1990s is
about 67, compared to about 72.5 and 74 for people born in the 1908s and
1970s respectively. Uncertainty is not quantified (e.g., confidence
intervals) in these plots, but statistical comparison of cohorts is
displayed further below in Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows the smooth GAM estimates, along with 95%
credible/confidence intervals (which include the uncertainty about the
overall mean as well as the centred smooth itself). In each row the
older cohort is shown in the left column as the reference smooth, and
the estimated difference between the reference and the younger cohort is
shown in the right column as the difference smooth.

<br>

The difference smooths (right panels) reveal where the younger cohort is
significantly different from the older reference cohort (left panels),
that is, where the confidence bounds exclude zero (horizontal line)
(Marra & Wood, 2012; Wood, 2013). Inspection of the 1990s difference
panel reveals the youngest cohort’s mental health trajectory is
significantly declining with age relative to the 1980s cohort. After the
age of 25, a person born in the 1990s is expected to have lower mental
health than an equivalently aged person born earlier (e.g., 1980s). The
other cohorts are also declining relative to their older reference
cohort, albeit not as substantial a decline and not as reliably below
zero as the 1990s difference smooth.

Statistical differences based on Nychka (1988) are shown below:

#### Table 3. Approximate significance of smooth differences

| term             | k-index |  edf | statistic |   p.value |
|:-----------------|--------:|-----:|----------:|----------:|
| 1990s difference |    0.98 | 1.00 |    147.41 | 0.0000000 |
| 1980s difference |    0.98 | 5.27 |     10.67 | 0.0000000 |
| 1970s difference |    1.00 | 3.68 |     11.52 | 0.0000009 |
| 1960s difference |    1.01 | 1.00 |      6.74 | 0.0094073 |
| 1950s difference |    1.02 | 3.04 |      0.55 | 0.5939511 |

<br>

The p-values indicate that nonlinear (i.e., smooth) differences exist
between each of the younger cohorts and the next oldest cohort, with the
exception of the 1950s cohort difference from 1940s.

<br>

#### Sensitivity Tests

In addition to the main analysis, we conducted several sensitivity
tests, the results of which are reported in the Appendix. First, we
tested for any gender differences in cohort effects of mental health
(Figure A1). The results are very similar to those reported for the full
sample in Figure 1. The intercepts for men and women are different, with
men’s average mental health being better than women’s average mental
health. However, men and women have similar mental health trajectory
differences between cohorts. Second, in 2011 the HILDA Survey added a
top-up sample of new respondents. This was also around the same time
that we start observing declines in mental health (see Figure 1, left
panel). To ensure that the declining mental health trajectories are not
driven by some unobserved characteristics of the respondents in the
top-up sample, we also conducted the analyses excluding top-sample
members. The results, shown in Figure A2, are similar to those in Figure
1 (right panel) and do not change the cohort trajectories. Third,
instead of the MHI-5, we also applied the Kessler-10 (K10) psychological
distress scale. K10 scores were collected in the HILDA Survey in
alternate years from 2007 to 2019. The corresponding psychological
distress trajectories for each cohort are shown in Figure A3, with
higher K10 scores suggesting greater psychological distress. The
trajectory patterns are consistent with those observed for the MHI-5
scale in Figure 1 (right panel), as psychological distress was higher
for younger cohorts than older cohorts at the same age.

<br><br>

## Discussion

Population levels of mental health in Australia have been declining over
the past decade or so. This is especially the case for younger adults
aged between 15 and 35. Although there has been consistent debate about
the possible drivers of these declining mental health trajectories
(Skinner et al., 2022), little work has been done to try and identify
more precisely the source of these patterns. Moreover, because of the
concurrent presence of both and age- and period- effects, correctly
disentangling such effects from any cohort effects are crucial if we are
to identify the groups most at risk, and hence most in need of
assistance.

Using 20 years of longitudinal data, we find that the observed
deterioration in mental health in Australia is most consistent with a
cohort effect. Importantly, it is the youngest cohorts and especially
1990s birth cohort that is experiencing a decreasing trajectory of
mental health over time. Individuals in this cohort report worse mental
health than older cohorts at the same ages, and can expect this
difference to increase. Thus, the deterioration in mental health over
time which has been reported in large cross-sectional surveys, is likely
due to cohort-specific effects, related to the experience of young
people born in the Millenial generation. These findings are similar for
men and women, and the results are robust to alternative samples and
measures used.

In comparison to other research on age effects in large population-based
surveys, there are few examples examining mental health but many have
focused on subjective wellbeing evaluated by a single item
life-satisfaction question, also known as *cognitive* wellbeing,
*evaluative* wellbeing or “happiness”. There it has been pointed out
that almost every plausible pattern of age-happiness trajectory has been
reported in the literature, and further shown the pattern observed
depends on the model adopted for analysis. For instance a U-shaped
effect of age can be produced by a random intercept model which yields
biased age effects due to endogenous selection of happier people with
age (Kratz & Brüderl, 2021). We also controlled for such endogenous
effects by mean centering MHI-5 scores within-person (and including the
mean score as a predictor, Ligthart-Smith, 2016), and still observed a
fairly U-shaped pattern in age effects (Figure 2, right panel, dotted
line). However the MHI-5 measures a distinct construct from
life-satisfaction (aka “happiness”), and so represents a distinct
psychological construct (Diener et al., 2017); for instance it has a
different time-course in responses to major life events (Kettlewell et
al., 2020). It is worth noting that when we examined age-effects on
life-satisfaction, we did not observe cohort specific trajectories as we
found with mental health.

We did not include major life events in our model because they can act
as mediators that result from age and affect the response. We also did
not include other potential mediators such as health status,
relationship status, employment status, household income or region. As
such our results should be considered estimates of the *total* effect of
age on mental health, rather than any causal association, which is
consistent with our aim to describe the age-related differences rather
than explain them.

This study is intended as a starting point for more in-depth analysis or
to invigorate other researchers to examine more closely the changes in
mental health happening in Australia in the last decade. Understanding
the exact causes of these patterns, in addition to appropriately
targeted interventions, may be critical if the deteriorating pattern is
to be arrested or shifted.

The difference between male and female MHi-5 trajectories is mostly in
the intercept (overall mean level). Men and women have similar
trajectory differences between cohorts.
